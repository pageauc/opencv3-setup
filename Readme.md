## Raspberry Pi Menu Driven OpenCV 3 Compile from Source Script
#### Whiptail menu enabled script to help compile opencv3 from source  

## Introduction
This Bash script uses a whiptail menu to assist users who want to 
compile opencv 3.2.0 or 3.3.0 from source. It is recommended you have a minimum
size 16GB SD card with at least 5GB free.  
To Check free disk space run

    df -h

The appropriate install menu script menu picks will 
* Update/upgrade Raspbian for Raspberry Pi
* Install build dependencies
* Download opencv3 source and unzip
* Run ***cmake*** to configure build
* Run ***make*** to Compile opencv3 source code
* Run ***make install*** to install new opencv python files
* Cleanup Files to release disk space (optional). 

Users will be prompted to review output for errors and elect to continue.  They can also repeat a
particular step from the menu if required

## Quick Install   
Easy Install of opencv3-setup onto a Raspberry Pi Computer with Recent Raspbian Jessie Build.
This is a whiptail menu system that allows install of opencv 3.2.0 or 3.3.0

    curl -L https://raw.github.com/pageauc/opencv3-setup/master/setup.sh | bash

From a computer logged into the RPI via ssh (Putty) session      
* use mouse to highlight command above, right click, copy.     
*  Then select ssh(Putty) window, mouse right click, paste.   
The command should download and run the install setup.sh script.

## Manual Install   
From logged in RPI SSH session or console terminal perform the following.

    wget https://raw.github.com/pageauc/opencv3-setup/master/setup.sh
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ./setup.sh

## How to Run Menu

A temporary working folder will be created to store the downloaded opencv
and source,build files. The Default location is /home/pi/tmp_cv3.  
***IMPORTANT*** If there is limited space on the Raspbian SD card
you may want to create a symoblic link to an external drive
or memory stick.  Then edit(nano) 

opencv32-install-menu.sh     
or   
opencv33-install-menu.sh   

Then change the ***install_dir*** variable to point to the symbolic link
for the external storage device.  ctrl-x y to save and exit nano. 

Sample commands to use an external ntfs usb hard drive.

    cd ~
    sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g   # Make sure ntfs support installed
    sudo fdisk -l     # will list drive if installed
    mkdir mnt
    sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /home/pi/mnt
    mkdir /home/pi/mnt/tmp_cv3
    ln -s /home/pi/mnt/tmp_cv3 tmp_cv3

To Run the whiptail menu setup script.    
From a logged in ssh or terminal session run

    cd ~/opencv3-setup
    ./cv32-install-menu.sh

or
    ./cv32-install-menu.sh
        
Select Menu items in order. You will be asked to review output logs for success
before proceeding to next step.
You may be asked to reboot at certain steps. After a Reboot login and run 
appropriate install menu script again then proceed to next menu item 

This install is based on   
https://github.com/Tes3awy/OpenCV-3.2.0-Compiling-on-Raspberry-Pi    

Note due to system security, there are some configuration steps that 
must be done manually using nano.
Please review Step 14 on link above for further instructions.
 
### Prerequisites

* RPI Connection to Internet    
* Reasonably Recent Jessie/Stretch Full Operating System Installed   
* Sufficient Free Disk Space > 5 GB  df -h to check. 
  To Free disk space see [How to Free Space on Raspbian](http://raspi.tv/2016/how-to-free-up-some-space-on-your-raspbian-sd-card-remove-wolfram-libreoffice)  
* Determine if RPI is a Quadcore cpu  cat /proc/cpuinfo        
* Basic knowledge of unix terminal commands   
* Patience since this will take a few hours
